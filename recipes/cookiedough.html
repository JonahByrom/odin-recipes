    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a simple recipe for edible cookie dough. It's eggless, so it's safe to eat raw, and it's delicious!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpse flour</li>
        <li>1/2 (1 stick) cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk, dairy, or nondairy</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup regular or mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, or a combination</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat-treat the flour: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment, add the flour and spread it into a thin layer. Bake flour for 5 minutes (see Tip). Cool flour completely.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Beat on medium-high with a hand mixer until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in milk and vanilla until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the salt, then sift in the flour. Beat on medium-low until well combined and no white streaks remain. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand with a spatula or wooden spoon. Serve immediately, using a cookie scoop or spoon to transfer to small bowls, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. (The cookie dough will be very soft if served right away; if youâ€™d like it a bit firmer, refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes and check the firmness, adding more time to increase firmness if desired. If refrigerated for several hours or overnight, bring it to room temperature about 30 minutes before serving to soften.)</li>
    </ol>
